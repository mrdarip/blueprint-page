          <p>This is a page made for testing css and meta tags, I've been curious about how does the search engine shows some data like the page title and description, appart from other advanced features like showing a banner when sharing the page!

          <h2>CSS?</h2>
          <p>
            You heard it right! This page is made for testing css,
            as you can see, the background is moving and the different sections seems themed
            with a typical blueprint style
          </p>

          <h3>What technical features does the style contais?</h3>
          <p>
            The page is responsive, try resizing! Appart from that, the style features mostly general rules, allowing you to write your html without worrying about the style, the only thing you need to do is to add the class "moving-check-bg" to the body tag, and the background will start moving! If you wanted too you could add it to a section and it would feature it as well!
          </p>
          <div class = "moving-check-bg" style="--white : #3cacb4; --blue:  #0e0446; animation-duration: 3s; height: 3em;"></div>
          <p>
            That's convenient! You can change the colors of the background by changing the values of the variables --white and --blue, and you can change the speed of the animation by changing the value of the variable animation-duration, the value is in seconds, so if you want to make it slower, you can change it to 5s, or if you want to make it faster, you can change it to 1s!
          </p>

          <h2>Meta tags?</h2>
          <p>
            As I said I wanted to test html SEO, so I added some meta tags, like the title and the description, I also added a meta tag for the author, and I added a meta tag for the keywords, altough I'm not sure if the keywords meta tag is still relevant, I added it anyway, just to test it out! Maybe it has no use to setup the page's SEO as it doesnt offer nothing to the user, but I think it's worth a try just for personal knowledge!

          <h2>Why is there so much text in this page?</h2>
          <p>
            I have to fill it with content and as writting lorem ipsum feels boring and I don't know anything about the subject, I'll just write about the page itself, I hope you don't mind!
            In fact now I'm going to type some filling text: This text has been written by hand (without using Chat GPT) and it's just a filler text, it's because I didn't use Chat GPT that it contains some errors, but I think it's fine, I'm just trying to fill the page with some content, not write an essay
